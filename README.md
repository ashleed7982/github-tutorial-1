## Git vs. GitHub
### What is Git?

Git is a system which keeps track of changes to code as different versions, which becomes the history that you can go back to or view. It runs in the command line, and displays all of the directories (called folders) that hold your files.

### What is Github?

Github is a website that allows you to keep your code in the cloud. It lets people collaborate with each other, since you can publish your repositories (or make them private!) for others to work on and add to. You can see the changes you have made (insert image here)

### How are they different?
The difference between Git and Github is that Github needs to use Git, but Git can run on its own, offline. Github can track your changes more visually than Git does, and is more convenient to use to work with others.
